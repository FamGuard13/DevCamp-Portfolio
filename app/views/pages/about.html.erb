            My passion for technology has been an integral part of my life. It has directed me from a job in Smart-Phone hardware repairs all the way to tinkering with the software on my Android device just to see what I could do with it. After starting a technology company, I realized the power that technology had and found a burning desire to be able to harness that power to help better peoples lives.

            For this reason I decided to dive head first into learning everything I could about Web Development. I wanted to be able to implement my own ideas as well as participate and aid others with their ideas. I have a passion for the work and a desire to continue learning more and more for the purpose of bettering my skill-set. As that skill-set grows, so will my ability to help others as well as my family and myself.
