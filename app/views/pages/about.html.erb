    <h1>Little History about me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Tanner. I'm a husband and a Father to two amazing boys. I was born in Salt Lake City, UT, but spent most of my childhood in Lovell, WY. After my freshman year in that little town of 2000 people, our family moved to Pocatello, ID where I graduated from Century High School.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon returning home from my church mission, I decided that I wanted to move back to Salt Lake City where I truly found my passion for technology, met my wife, and have been blessed with two fantastic children. That's me in a nutshell, I look forward to getting to know you more.

      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>
        Throughout my entire life, I have always had a tinkering for technology. It started out with me enjoying video games on the computer like Age of Mythology or Age of Empires. I remember tinkering with the video-game by adding music in the file-system, or getting icon sets and replacing the default ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        This intrigue continued and when I moved to Salt Lake City, where I've had an assortment of jobs that involved technology. The first being a Repair Technician at a phone repair shop. When that company was sold, I shifted to T-Mobile where I got the opportunity to work closeley with people and their cellular needs. During my tenure at T-Mobile I started a company that was based in networking, which was an great learning experience. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It was that company, Family-Guard, that solidified a passion in me that building things was what I loved. As I looked back at each company I worked for, there was an underlying project that I had that dealt more the building something, usually making small little programs in excel to better track my own personal goals. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I sold Family-Guard and enrolled in the Bottega Bootcamp to begin my journey into Web Development. It challenged me in a way that I hadn't been challenged before and my entire way of thinking had to shift. I learned to think about problems in a more detailed way, break something in to little steps, and learned how to learn so to speak. 
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In addition to Bottega, I picked up 'The Odin Project' that I used a supplement to start, but it turned into a primary curriculum all on it's own. Their approach to hands on and baptism by fire was essential for me to be confident in my skillset.
